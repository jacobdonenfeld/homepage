There is a significant presence of wheels-skateboards, longboards, freelines-on Harvey Mudd's campus. While anyone could buy one, I saw this as an opportunity to make my own. 

Before I decided on aluminum, I had to consider material properties: weight, youngs modulus, yield point, and ease of manufactoring. Most longboards use plys of wood with fiberglass layers for a great strength to weight ratio. However, I do not have a deck press needed for making longboards from plys of wood. I decided to go with aircraft grade aluminum. Although it would be heavy, it would be strong which allows interesting designs and for taking off material from the inside. This could reduce the weight a little. 

### Materials and Resources Used
* 7071 T6 Aluminum 1'x4'x.5"
* Waterjet Cutter
* Prototyping Plywood 2'x4'x1"
* Solidworks

Research to find out the normal dimentions of a longboard showed most are 10 inches wide, ranging from 36 to 42 inches long. I decided to make mine 38 inches long. 

Thick 7071 aluminum allowed me to experiment with some unique shapes while not worrying about plastic deformation. I came up with the following designs:

I decided to use the second design for simplicity and eligance. 

I am current at the point of prototyping with plywood.
